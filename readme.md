# What?
An exercise in Backbone.js and using the Airbnb api. Some of the ideas might be extracted into a concept I'm playing with, Backbone Glue, since Backbone is so losely coupled it could use some glue to stick it together.
# Setup
```
gem install compass
gem install haml
npm install -g coffee-script
```
